# How well is the solution
## 1. Readable
that another developer can understand the solution in the most easily way.

## 2. Scalability
accomplish the next characteristics even if the code works.

> its important knowing how much scalable the solution it has to be

## efficient
memory and runtime optimum

## effective
can solve the problem given properly

## 3. development time
it consist in taking care about how much time the developer team should expend in readability and scalability, it depend in the context, some times we just want to be faster and not work in a strong scalable solution.

# scalability 
we can measure a code depending on time because it the runtime depends in the machine and some other factors like the language. instead we use big O notation:
