1. use the first unordered element (pivot element)
2. traverse all the list searching for smaller or equals ones
3. at this point there is ready to order side (left), and unordered side (right)
4. place the selected one at the end of the left side (it is the biggest one), and execute the first step until the left side is organized
5. at this point there is ordered side (left) and unordered (right)

by organizing all the left side found, the list will be totally ordered
