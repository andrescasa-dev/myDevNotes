# Linked list
is very similar to an Array, but is **easier to mutate**. [visualize one](https://visualgo.net/en/list?slide=1)

|method|list | array|
|--|--|--|
|insert at first| o(1) | o(n)
|insert at end| o(1) | o(n) (depending if the array expands creating a copy)

# Build
most languages doesn't have a prebuild list because is a low level data structure (modern languages implemented it under the hood), but its easy to create one, all **you need is a white board**
