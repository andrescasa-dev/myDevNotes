a perfect tree has a exponential growth base on its height. 

`n = hÂ² - 1`

The level increase 2 times that the previous level.

# what means O(log(n))

`log(n)`

the worst case is that we need to find a node on the bottom of the tree, so its **complexity would be the hight of the tree**.

If we know the amount of elements we could calculate the height, in other words, the big o
