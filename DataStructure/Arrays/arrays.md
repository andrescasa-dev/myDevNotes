# Big O
 - inserting O(n)
 - delete O(n)
 - access O(1)
 - pop O(1)

> Easy to traverse.

In JS arrays are objects so it can be dynamic, we don't need to make a copy if we fill out the array. just add one more element.

> in JS pop() is O(1)

# when to use it
- when a manipulate the elements using indexes
- some cases push and pop
- data in sequential order, we must traverse easy

# methods and complexity ---(complete please)---

- insertion
- search
- push
- delete

# what is a collision

# solutions to collisions?

# literals vs Maps vs Sets ---(complete please)---
all of them are has tables
