# Custom Hooks
It's the modern alternative of render props. It's a function where we implement the logic that we want to reuse. if its needed we can add state to that logic using useState, but it isn't a component since a custom Hooks has to return an array with the variables (or functions) that we want to consume in the component where we are reusing the logic
