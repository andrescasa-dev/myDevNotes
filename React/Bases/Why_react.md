# Why React

## it's composable
we can create components using functions.
Components let us divide the HTML and build up a more organize app.

## it's declarative
*what to do* don't worry about how to do it. Its faster and the low-level implementation (imperative code) can be improve over the time. 

> it's simpler => i can build apps faster.
